UPLOAD PHOTO
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- Uploading should be done by being able to drop an image on the drop field or using the upload button
- Preview image in the field
- Save image button disabled if no watermark png is selected
- Merge watermark png with image in php backend
- Save watermarked upload to database
- Feedback when photo has been saved to the database has been successful or failed.

NOTES?

First finish the create_photo.php in itâ€™s entirety since a lot of the same things will be used in upload_photo.php.
Feedback could be done by changing the color and innerHTML of the button



DASHBOARD
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- Edit uploaded image so one can choose other watermarks for the photo.



HOMEPAGE
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- Photos should be visible to anyone accessing the website.
- Only the user specific photos should be deletable and editable.
- Sorting, new to last.
- Only logged in users should be able to comment and like.
- Comments and likes should be visible even when not logged in.

NOTES?

None. Pretty self-explanatory



LOGIN / REGISTER
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- Forgot password buttons.
- Submit form while pressing enter?

NOTES?

This may be a little hard to do to figure out which form has been submitted.



DESIGN
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- Design should be fully responsive, which it obviously is not yet.
