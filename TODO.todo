Camagru project

WIP

DASHBOARD
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- Delete uploaded images


TODO

CREATE PHOTO
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- No watermark png selected, save image button disabled
- Edit capture image with chosen watermark png
- Merge watermark png with image in php backend
- Save watermarked capture to database
- No empty photo should be allowed to be saved.
- Feedback when photo has been saved to the database has been successful or failed.

NOTES?

Think about using more modules for the watermark png’s since they will also be used at upload_photo.php, just like the navbar and footer for DRY principle*.
Think about refactoring code first before starting on any other pages for the modules.
Feedback could be done by changing the color and innerHTML of the button



UPLOAD PHOTO
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- Uploading should be done by being able to drop an image on the drop field or using the upload button
- Preview image in the field
- Save image button disabled if no watermark png is selected
- Merge watermark png with image in php backend
- Save watermarked upload to database
- Feedback when photo has been saved to the database has been successful or failed.

NOTES?

First finish the create_photo.php in it’s entirety since a lot of the same things will be used in upload_photo.php.
Feedback could be done by changing the color and innerHTML of the button



DASHBOARD
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- Delete uploaded images
- Edit uploaded image so one can choose other watermarks for the photo.
- Change the photogrid system to a foreach loop. (use display: grid )

NOTES?

When updating password, keep in mind the password has to be at least 6 characters long.



HOMEPAGE
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- Photos should be visible to anyone accessing the website.
- Only the user specific photos should be deletable and editable.
- Sorting, new to last.
- Only logged in users should be able to comment and like.
- Comments and likes should be visible even when not logged in.

NOTES?

None. Pretty self-explanatory



LOGIN / REGISTER
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- Forgot password or change password buttons.
- Submit form while pressing enter?

NOTES?

This may be a little hard to do to figure out which form has been submitted.



DESIGN
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- Design should be fully responsive, which it obviously is not yet.
